The Greene Lab's research focuses on biochemistry, molecular biology, and structural biology, with an emphasis on understanding enzyme function and regulation in human health and disease. This research platform serves as a training pipeline for students to learn cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) as it applies to the study of enzyme conformational heterogeneity. Enzymes must undergo conformational changes to enhance enzymatic catalysis, and most enzymes form complexes that are available for structural determination by cryo-EM. Overall, the Greene lab aims to elucidate the fundamental principles of enzyme activity and regulation, as this basic knowledge contributes to potential therapeutic advancements.
