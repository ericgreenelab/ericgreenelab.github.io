Ensemble-function analysis of human glutamine synthetase. We work in large teams to solve cryo-EM structures, perform MD ensemble refinement, and rationalize functional hypotheses for what conformations confer what features to the enzyme. We then experimentally test our hypotheses biochemically and with further structural models.
