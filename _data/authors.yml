greene-eric:
  name:        Eric Greene
  bio:         Assistant Professor
  
               Department Chemistry and Biochemistry
  fullbio:     "Eric graduated from the University of Colorado, Boulder with degrees in Biochemistry and Molecular, Cellular, and Development Biology. As an undergraduate, he worked with Dr. Zhongping Tan using chemical biology approaches to study glycosylated proteins.


    As a graduate student in [Dr. Andy Martin’s](http://mcb.berkeley.edu/labs/martin/) lab at UC Berkeley, Eric studied how conformations and conformational dynamics of the 26S proteasome influence degradation processes. He also collaborated with [Dr. Susan Marqusee’s](https://zebra.berkeley.edu) lab to help illuminate how energetic changes conferred by site-specific ubiquitination on substrate proteins influenced whether, and how, these proteins were degraded by the proteasome.


    Eric was a postdoc in [James Fraser's](https://fraserlab.com) lab at UCSF, where he worked on project seeking to understand how protein conformations impact function and regulation, and, how posttranslational factors that occur throughout a protein’s lifetime further tune function."

hernandez-emily:
  name:        Emily Hernandez
  bio:         SEO scholar pursuing M.S. in Biochemistry
  fullbio:     "I am a First Gen Latina, and first year Master's Student I got my Bachelor's of Science in Biochemistry with a minor in Race and Resistance this last Spring. During my undergrad I did Biochemistry research with Dr. Greene in the Greene lab. 
  
  
  Continuing my work with him as a graduate student, I am studying Tau protein amyloid conformations in diseases by inducing fibril formation with chemicals like sodium alginate and analyzing their structures using Cryo-EM. I'm also part of SEO as an NIH-Bridge MS Scholar and Secretary of the Chemistry and Biochemistry Student Association here on campus. Outside of school I love to travel, my most recent trip was a solo trip to Japan!
