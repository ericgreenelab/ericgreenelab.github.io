greene-eric:
  name:        Eric Greene
  bio:         Assistant Professor
  
               Department Chemistry and Biochemistry
  fullbio:     "Eric graduated from the University of Colorado, Boulder with degrees in Biochemistry and Molecular, Cellular, and Development Biology. As an undergraduate, he worked with Dr. Zhongping Tan using chemical biology approaches to study glycosylated proteins.


    As a graduate student in [Dr. Andy Martin’s](http://mcb.berkeley.edu/labs/martin/) lab at UC Berkeley, Eric studied how conformations and conformational dynamics of the 26S proteasome influence degradation processes. He also collaborated with [Dr. Susan Marqusee’s](https://zebra.berkeley.edu) lab to help illuminate how energetic changes conferred by site-specific ubiquitination on substrate proteins influenced whether, and how, these proteins were degraded by the proteasome.


    Eric was a postdoc in [James Fraser's](https://fraserlab.com) lab at UCSF, where he worked on project seeking to understand how protein conformations impact function and regulation, and, how posttranslational factors that occur throughout a protein’s lifetime further tune function."

  fullbio:     "Markus is using a combination of biochemical, biophysical, and computational techniques to explore how human glutamine synthetase communicates through allosteric pathways. This enzyme plays a key role in both cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, making the discoveries especially exciting for future therapies. In addition to being an SF State Scholar, I am a NIH U-RISE, NSF CSU-LSAMP Fellow, and McKinney Scholar.


     Outside of the lab, Markus loves to spend time with his cat and play video games. He is also an avid photographer, runner, and pretends to know how to play piano!"
